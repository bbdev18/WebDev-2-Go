Coding Lessons - For loop precursor

Precursor to a for loop.
Let us say we want to print out the following rows of numbers:

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 

We can do this manually using the stand printing function.
Now let us try automate this process by restricting the number of rows we want to print 
with an if statement. So in this case we want to print only 5 rows of numbers.

So let us create a variable called `start = 1` and `end = 5`. Now we want to be able to create
a counter that will add `1` to the start number each time until we get to `5`. So we create
a variable count `counter`. So for example, let us first print out the row numbers:

`start = 1`
`end = 5`
`counter = start`

print(counter)
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)
counter = counter + 1
print(counter)

This should show:
1
2
3
4
5
6

Which shows 1 more number than we actually want. We can just delete the last two lines but
let us add some restrictions to the code. Now let us add an if condition that checks if we reached the correct
number of rows we want to print:  

`start = 1`
`end = 5`
`counter = start`

if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 1
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}

if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 2
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}
if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 3
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}
if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 4
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}
if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 5
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}
if (counter <= 5)
{
	print(counter)
	# 6
	counter = counter + 1
}
else
{
	print("limit reached")
}

So  you see now only 5 rows of numbers were printed and the last statement said limit was reached!
