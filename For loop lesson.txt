For loop lesson:

A for loop is a built in statement that repeats a piece of code a certain number of times.
For example, if you write print out a square of stars you can do it like this:
print("*****")
print("*****")
print("*****")
print("*****")
print("*****")

Output:

*****
*****
*****
*****
*****

But this is a bit of a long process to keep on having to print the same thing over again.
The rule of programming is if you have to write the same line of code twice then you 
need to automate it. And we can automate it with a for loop. So we will get the same result with:
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i = i+1)
{
	print("*****")
}

Now let us go into detail with a for loop. So a for loop has 3 parameters you need to define:
1. where does the loop start from (start)
2. where does the loop end using a condition (end)
3. how does the loop count or iterate (count)
for (start; end; count)

So I am going to rewrite the for loop above but give it more descriptive variable names to help teach
the concept:

int start = 1;
int end = 5;

for(int count = start; count <= end; count = count + 1)
{
	print("*****")
}
print("for loop is done")

Ok so what is happening in memory:
Mem: start = 1
Mem: end = 5

1. firstly, count = start so:
Mem: count = 1
2. Then the for loop begins its first loop by first checking if the condition is true, else it will exit:
if (count <= end)
{
	print("*****")
	count = count + 1
}
Mem: count = 2
3. Second loop, checks if the condition is true else it will exit the for loop:
if (count <= end)
{
	print("*****")
	count = count + 1
}
Mem: count = 3
4. Third loop, checks if the condition is true else it will exit the for loop:
if (count <= end)
{
	print("*****")
	count = count + 1
}
Mem: count = 4
5. Fourth loop, checks if the condition is true else it will exit the for loop:
if (count <= end)
{
	print("*****")
	count = count + 1
}
Mem: count = 5
6. Fifth loop, checks if the condition is true else it will exit the for loop:
if (count <= end)
{
	print("*****")
	count = count + 1
}
Mem: count = 6
7. Sixth loop, checks if the condition is true. Which it is not as count < end is false as 6 > 5. So it will exit the for loop and do the statement: `print("for loop is done")`
